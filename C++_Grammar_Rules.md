To develop a minimal C++ interpreter that accurately parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions, it's essential to understand the relevant C++ grammar rules. Here's a concise overview:

## 1. Operator Precedence and Associativity

C++ defines a hierarchy of operator precedence that dictates the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. Associativity determines the direction of evaluation for operators with the same precedence level. Most arithmetic operators are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.

**Example:**

```cpp
int result = 5 - 3 - 2; // Evaluated as (5 - 3) - 2 = 0
```

For a detailed table of operator precedence and associativity, refer to the [C++ Operator Precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence) documentation.

## 2. Arithmetic Operators

The primary arithmetic operators in C++ include:

- **Addition (`+`)**: Combines two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Finds the difference between two operands.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Finds the remainder of division between two operands.

These operators follow standard mathematical rules, and their precedence affects the order of operations in expressions.

**Example:**

```cpp
int sum = 3 + 4 * 5; // Multiplication has higher precedence, so evaluated as 3 + (4 * 5) = 23
```

For more details, see [C++ Arithmetic Operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-arithmetic-operators/).

## 3. Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand. In arithmetic expressions, the unary minus (`-`) is commonly used to denote negation.

**Example:**

```cpp
int negative = -5;
```

Proper handling of unary operators is crucial for accurate expression evaluation.

## 4. Parentheses for Grouping

Parentheses `()` are used to explicitly specify the desired order of evaluation in expressions. They override the default precedence rules, ensuring that the enclosed expression is evaluated first.

**Example:**

```cpp
int result = (2 + 3) * 4; // Addition is performed before multiplication, resulting in 20
```

## 5. Grammar for Arithmetic Expressions

To parse arithmetic expressions effectively, a simplified context-free grammar (CFG) can be defined as follows:

```
Expression   → Term | Expression '+' Term | Expression '-' Term
Term         → Factor | Term '*' Factor | Term '/' Factor | Term '%' Factor
Factor       → Primary | '-' Primary
Primary      → Number | '(' Expression ')'
Number       → [0-9]+
```

This grammar ensures that multiplication, division, and modulus operations have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, aligning with C++'s operator precedence rules.

## 6. Parsing Techniques

Implementing a parser requires choosing an appropriate parsing technique. Recursive descent parsing is a common method where each non-terminal in the grammar is represented by a function in the parser. This approach is straightforward and aligns well with the structure of arithmetic expressions.

For an in-depth explanation, refer to this [discussion on formal grammars](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/23738/grammar-for-parsing-simple-mathematical-expression).

## 7. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

During parsing, constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is beneficial. An AST represents the hierarchical structure of the expression, with each node corresponding to a construct occurring in the source code. This tree structure facilitates efficient evaluation and manipulation of expressions.

By understanding and implementing these C++ grammar rules and parsing techniques, you can develop an interpreter that accurately parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions, ensuring consistency with standard C++ behavior.
